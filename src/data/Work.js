            'The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/ (About this soundlisten), Procyon lotor), sometimes spelled racoon,[3] also known as the common raccoon,[4] North American raccoon,[5], northern raccoon,[6] or coon, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in) and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb).[7] Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoons most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years.[8] They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.'
